# Nezir Erdoğan

👋 Hi, I'm Nezir Erdoğan.

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, focused on understanding how real-world systems work — and how they break.

Alongside my goal of specializing in cybersecurity, I actively work on backend and full-stack projects to gain hands-on experience with system architecture, authentication mechanisms, APIs, and databases. I approach software development with a security-oriented mindset, combining engineering fundamentals with analytical thinking.

My long-term goal is to grow into a security-focused software engineer with a strong hacker mindset, capable of analyzing systems from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
